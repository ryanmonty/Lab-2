        <h2>Alternative study environments</h2>
            <p>
                Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room,...Varying the place you study helps you remember more.
            </p>
 
        <h2>Mix Content</h2>
            <p>
                Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some of this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember more.
            </p>

        <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
            <p>Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session</p>

        <h2>Self-testing</h2>
            <p>
                Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know. <br />
                CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.
